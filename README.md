This is simple paycheck Python program.

This program is designed to accept user input information.  The user is prompted to input the rate of pay per hour that they recieve, and then requested to input how many hours for the week that they have worked.  They are provided the gross pay based on those hours, along with the net pay based on a 20$ deduction.  The program has emojis included, which requires the emoji libray to be imported. 

Bug Report:
Other than having issues getting some of the emojis that I chose to work, and initially forgetting how to save the Dockerfile, I was able to add the file via Powershell with no extension.  The program seems to run fine.
